## Project Overview

- **Client Partner:** General Motors  
- **Challenge Timeline:** February 2024 – March 2024  
- **Objective:** Identify conversion frictions in GM’s digital email campaigns and recommend data-backed strategies to improve performance metrics across the user journey

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** Proprietary Adobe Analytics data provided under NDA  
- **Scope:** 12.7 million emails sent in Q4 2023 with full event-level journey tracking (sent -> open → click → purchase)

---

## Tools & Methods

- Used **Adobe Customer Journey Analytics (CJA)** to conduct:
  - Time-of-day and weekday vs. weekend performance breakdowns
  - Session behavior and duration analysis across devices
  - Email-to-purchase funnel drop-off evaluation
  - Click-through and open rate segmentation by content and CTA type
  - Audience segmentation for SUV, EV, and loyalty-based subgroups  
- Strategy driven by behavioral pattern analysis and funnel metrics

## Assumptions & Strategy Framework

| Area                  | Strategic Insight & Rationale                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Email Send Time        | Weekdays showed higher open rates, while weekends had longer session durations—suggesting a dual-strategy for timing content |
| Content Format         | Quick-action visual content outperformed long-format on weekdays; informative content favored on weekends |
| CTA Design             | Low visibility of CTA buttons impacted engagement; buttons were buried below the fold        |
| Segmentation Approach  | Different personas (e.g., SUV fans vs. EV buyers) responded differently to tone and product focus |
| Deliverability Factor  | Cleaning the email list improved bounce rate and ensured more relevant impressions           |

## Key Results & Business Impact

| Funnel Stage        | Metric                  | Baseline (Q4 2023)   | Post-Strategy Estimate  |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Open Rate           | Email Open Rate         | 59.7%                 | 65.7% (+10%)             |
| Click-Through Rate  | CTR                     | 9.2%                  | 12.0% (+30%)             |
| Conversion Rate     | Purchase Rate           | 0.20%                 | 0.25% (+25%)             |
| Revenue             | Estimated Vehicle Sales | $1.7B                 | $2.55B (+50%)            |

- Funnel analysis revealed **major drop-offs post-open**, primarily caused by generic content and poor CTA visibility
- Strategy focused on **content tailoring by day-type**, **audience-specific messaging**, and **continual A/B testing**
- Projected GM’s email campaign revenue to rise by **$850M annually** if recommendations were implemented

---

## Key Deliverables

- **Interactive dashboard** with funnel KPIs (open, click, purchase)
- **Executive presentation** with strategic recommendations and estimated financial lift
- **Email optimization playbook** outlining content strategy, segmentation, send-time targeting, and A/B test design

## What I Learned

- Behavioral segmentation and time-based breakdowns can reveal hidden friction in digital customer journeys
- Adobe Analytics is a powerful platform, but requires structured hypotheses and clear KPIs for effective insights
- Translating data analysis into a clear business case is critical in high-stakes competitive consulting projects

---

## What I Plan to Improve

- Deepen hands-on experience with Adobe Analytics API and its integration into Python workflows
- Incorporate multi-channel attribution modeling and lifetime value tracking in similar funnel analysis projects
